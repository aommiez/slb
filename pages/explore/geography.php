    <p class="section-geo" style="text-indent:50px;"><b>Located in the center of Southeast Asia, Thailand is truly at the heart of the region.  Looking over a map of Thailand will
        reveal a country whose borders form the rough shape of an elephant’s head: the head and ears forming the mostly
        landlocked northern and eastern provinces and the trunk extending down the Malaysian peninsula between the Andaman
        Sea and the Gulf of Thailand.</b></p>
    <div class="pull-right relative-block" style="margin-left: 22px;">
        <img class="relative-block" style="z-index: 1;" src="images/Geography/Geography454x309.png">

    <div style="width: 444px;">
        <p style="text-indent:50px;">
            The geography of Thailand features many natural borders with neighboring
            countries: a mountainous border with Myanmar (Burma) to the north and
            west; a long stretch of the Mekong River separating Thailand from Laos to
            the north and east; and the Mekong River and the Dongrak Mountains
            delineating the border of Cambodia to the east. 
        </p>

        <p style="text-indent:50px;">
            The geography of Thailand’s interior is dominated by the Central Plains, the “Rice Bowl of Asia,” through which the Chao Phraya River feeds expansive rice fields and then enters the bustling capital of Bangkok before spilling into the Gulf of Thailand.
        </p>

        <p style="text-indent: 50px">
            Stretching down the Malaysian peninsula, the slender trunk of the figurative elephant separates the Andaman Sea from the Gulf of Thailand, providing Thailand with beaches and islands along opposing shores. Once, the sheltered coves of the narrow Isthmus of Kra were important ports along an ancient, strategic trading route; today the islands of Phuket and Koh Samui are equally important as tourist destinations, though both coasts also contain numerous historical attractions as well as national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and spectacular forests, waterfalls, and beaches.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent:50px;">
            In addition to these natural, geographical regions, Thailand is divided into 76 political provinces, with Bangkok serving as the political, commercial, industrial, educational, and entertainment capital of the country.
