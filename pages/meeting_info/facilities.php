        <p>5 Mbps wifi will be available at all area in the hotel where SiNet will be available only at the conference area including main meeting room and breakout rooms. However we do not recommend to bring your laptop to the main meeting room as the activities will be very dynamic. You may need your laptop only for workshop session.</p>
